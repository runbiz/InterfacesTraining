# Infrastructure
The **Infrastructure** project is where we will instantiate our database connection. In this case, we are building a **DbContext** connected to a *SQL Server* database, with the connection string being provided by the *appsettings.json* file in the *Interfaces.UI* project.

This project is also where we will perform **Entity Framework *(EF)*** migrations.
