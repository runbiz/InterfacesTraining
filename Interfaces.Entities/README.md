# Entities
The entities project is used only to store the entity-level classes of the business application. This is where your database will look to create it's entities from. Here we have our three main entity classes for this test application:
* Account
* Developer
* Department

These classes will not be referred to by the UI or displayed directly to the user. Instead, we will use **AutoMapper** and **DTO** classes to map our entity classes into DTO objects that display only the information we want our clients to see.

The entity classes also utilize data annotations to set up any validations/requirements/conditions of the entities *(ex. required fields, string length, foreign keys/relationships, etc.)*.

Our *Interfaces.Infrastructure* project will refer to these entity classes when setting up our *DbContext*.
